## Welcome on my Github page

I'm a French developer working for the **French Nuclear Authority**.

I'm also a student at ENSEEIHT, graduating in Computer Sciences and Networks.

My specialty is web programming, with the full-stack framework MeteorJS. I'm also competent in ReactJS, node.js and
Express tech stack. I also have a background in automated testing and code proofing with CEA and INRIA tools (Coq, Why3, FramaC).
